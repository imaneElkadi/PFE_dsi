    <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
    <p>The first thing that attracts people to you is your appearance, either it’s a neat appearance, or it’s boring and inappropriate. <br>
Many women struggle to choose the right colours for their skin and clothes adapted to their morphology<br>
Women end up buying a lot of clothes and not using them because they are often victims of fashion.  So she buys something that doesn’t suit <br>
her at all, simply because it suits others and is widespread.<br>
Similarly, women struggle to choose the appropriate costume for each specific venue or occasion, such as what to wear for a job interview or a<br> 
specific meeting.<br>
You find a lot of lost women on social media sites, watching fashionistas and bloggers, so they drown in endless cycles of confusion and take no <br>
advantage of anything because, Simply put, Instagram and y and others aim to make profit and sell products and they do not care about your appearance<br>
 and what exactly suits you.</p></div>
