           choose right colours for their <br>
           skin andclothes adapted to their<br>
           morphology Women end up buying <br>
           a lot of clothes and not using<br>
           them because they are often  <br>
           victims of fashion.  So she buys <br>
           something that doesn’t suit her  <br>
           at all, simply because it suits <br>
           others and is  widespread.<br></dd> </dl>
