--Wear sunscreen: Sun damage can cause premature aging and skin damage, so it's important to protect your skin <br>
 by wearing sunscreen every day. Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, and reapply every <br>
  two hours if you're outdoors. <br><br>

--Exfoliate once or twice a week: Exfoliating removes dead skin cells and allows new, healthy skin to surface. <br>
 Use a gentle exfoliator once or twice a week, depending on your skin's sensitivity, to keep your skin looking <br>
  fresh and glowing. <br><br>

--Stay hydrated and eat a balanced diet: Drinking plenty of water and eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, <br>
 vegetables, and healthy fats can do wonders for your skin. Staying hydrated helps flush out toxins and keeps <br>
  your skin looking plump and healthy, while a balanced diet provides essential nutrients that promote skin health.</p>
